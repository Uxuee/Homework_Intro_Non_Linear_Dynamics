## Question 2

a) Establish the system corresponding to the Hamiltonian function:

![midterm_13.png](HTMLFiles/midterm_13.png)

Analyze the singularities, establish through level curves, the phase portrait, and plot the Hamiltonian function.

![midterm_34.png](HTMLFiles/midterm_34.png)

We observe that it is not a hyperbolic singular point, and the Lyapunov theorem can be applied. Let's try with \(V(x,y) = H(x,y) = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\).
